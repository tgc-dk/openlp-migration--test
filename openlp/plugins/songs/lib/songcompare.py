"""
The :mod:`songcompare` module provides functionality to search for
duplicate songs. It has one single :func:`songs_probably_equal`.

| The algorithm is based on the diff algorithm.
| First a diffset is calculated for two songs.
| To compensate for typos all differences that are smaller than a
  limit (<max_typo_size) and are surrounded by larger equal blocks
  (>min_fragment_size) are removed and the surrounding equal parts are merged.
| Finally two conditions can qualify a song tuple to be a duplicate:

    1. There is a block of equal content that is at least min_block_size large.
       This condition should hit for all larger songs that have a long enough
       equal part. Even if only one verse is equal this condition should still hit.
    2. Two thirds of the smaller song is contained in the larger song.
       This condition should hit if one of the two songs (or both) is small (smaller
       than the min_block_size), but most of the song is contained in the other song.
