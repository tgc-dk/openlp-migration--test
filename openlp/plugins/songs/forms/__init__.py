"""
Forms in OpenLP are made up of two classes. One class holds all the graphical
elements, like buttons and lists, and the other class holds all the functional
code, like slots and loading and saving.

The first class, commonly known as the **Dialog** class, is typically named
``Ui_<name>Dialog``. It is a slightly modified version of the class that the
``pyuic5`` command produces from Qt5's .ui file. Typical modifications will be
converting most strings from "" to '' and using OpenLP's ``translate()``
function for translating strings.

The second class, commonly known as the **Form** class, is typically named
``<name>Form``. This class is the one which is instantiated and used. It uses
dual inheritance to inherit from (usually) QtWidgets.QDialog and the Ui class
mentioned above, like so::

    class AuthorsForm(QtWidgets.QDialog, Ui_AuthorsDialog):

        def __init__(self, parent=None):
            super(AuthorsForm, self).__init__(parent)
            self.setupUi(self)

This allows OpenLP to use ``self.object`` for all the GUI elements while keeping
them separate from the functionality, so that it is easier to recreate the GUI
from the .ui files later if necessary.
