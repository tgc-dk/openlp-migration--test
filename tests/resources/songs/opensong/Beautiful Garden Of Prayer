;Test breaks and newlines
;A single | on the end of a line adds an extra \n
;Blank lines are ignored, even with a space prefix
;We also check that the chorus is added after the verses, despite the order in the file
[V1]
 There's a garden where Jesus is waiting,
 
 There's a place that is wondrously fair.
 For it glows with the light of His presence,|
 'Tis the beautiful garden of prayer.

;A double || on a line adds a new slide
[C]
 O the beautiful garden, the garden of prayer,
 O the beautiful garden of prayer.
 There my Savior awaits, and He opens the gates
 ||
 To the beautiful garden of prayer.

;A double || on the end of a line adds a new slide
[V2]
 There's a garden where Jesus is waiting,
 And I go with my burden and care.
 Just to learn from His lips, words of comfort,||
 In the beautiful garden of prayer.

;A single | on a line adds just one line break
[V3]
 There's a garden where Jesus is waiting,
 And He bids you to come meet Him there,
 Just to bow and receive a new blessing,
 |
 In the beautiful garden of prayer.
