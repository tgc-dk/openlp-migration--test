AMAZING GRACE
-------------

1. AMAZING GRACE! HOW SWEET THE SOUND
THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME;
I ONCE WAS LOST, BUT NOW AM FOUND;
WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE.

2. 'TWAS GRACE THAT TAUGHT MY HEART TO FEAR
AND GRACE MY FEARS RELIEVED;
HOW PRECIOUS DID THAT GRACE APPEAR,
THE HOUR I FIRST BELIEVED!

3. THROUGH MANY DANGERS, TRIALS AND SNARES
I HAVE ALREADY COME;
'TIS GRACE THAT BROUGHT ME SAFE THUS FAR
AND GRACE WILL LEAD ME HOME.

4. THE LORD HAS PROMISED GOOD TO ME,
HIS WORD MY HOPE SECURES;
HE WILL MY SHIELD AND FORTRESS BE
AS LONG AS LIFE ENDURES.

5. WHEN WE'VE BEEN THERE TEN THOUSAND YEARS
BRIGHT SHINING AS THE SUN,
WE'VE NO LESS DAYS TO SING GOD'S PRAISE
THAN WHEN WE'D FIRST BEGUN.
