AMAZING GRACE, HOW SWEET THE SOUND
----------------------------------

1. AMAZING GRACE, HOW SWEET THE SOUND
THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME
I ONCE WAS LOST, BUT NOW I'M FOUND
WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE

2. 'TWAS GRACE THAT TAUGHT MY HEART TO FEAR
AND GRACE MY FEARS RELIEVED
HOW PRECIOUS DID THAT GRACE APPEAR
THE HOUR I FIRST BELIEVED

3. THROUGH MANY DANGERS, TOILS AND SNARES
I HAVE ALREADY COME,  'TWAS GRACE
THAT BROUGHT ME SAFE THUS FAR
AND GRACE WILL LEAD ME HOME

4. WHEN WE'VE BEEN THERE TEN THOUSAND YEARS
BRIGHT SHINING AS THE SUN
WE'VE NO LESS DAYS TO SING GOD'S PRAISE
THAN WHEN WE'VE FIRST BEGUN

5. PRAISE GOD, PRAISE GOD
PRAISE GOD, PRAISE GOD
PRAISE GOD, PRAISE GOD
PRAISE GOD..
