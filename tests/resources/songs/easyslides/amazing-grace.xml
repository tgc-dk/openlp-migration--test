Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me;
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.
[2]
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed!
[3]
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.
[4]
The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.
[5]
Yes, when this heart and flesh shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace.
[6]
When we've been there a thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.</Contents>
