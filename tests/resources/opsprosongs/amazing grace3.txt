Amazing grace! How sweet the sound!
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

[taal a]
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved.
[taal b]
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed.

[trans off]
The Lord has promised good to me,
His Word my hope secures.
[trans on]
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

[vertaal uit]
Thro' many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come.
[vertaal aan]
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

[end]
When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise,
Than when we first begun.
